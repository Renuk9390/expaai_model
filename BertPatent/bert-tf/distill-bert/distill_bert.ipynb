    "    \"Mice, although small, can still cause much damage.\",\n",
    "    \" They destroy articles such as food, books, furniture and even appliances with their gnawing, urine and faeces.\",\n",
    "    \" Another undesirable trait associated with mice, particularly in domestic environments, is their association with a variety of human diseases, such as for example, asthma.\",\n",
    "    \" Mice can also spread a variety of organisms that can cause diseases of humans and pets.\",\n",
    "    \" These include a variety of food poisoning bacteria like Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli (E.\",\n",
    "    \" coli), and others.\",\n",
    "    \" While the risk of mouse invasion is able to be somewhat controlled or minimised by preventing food waste such as crumbs accumulating in the home, or ensuring that stored food is isolated from the external environment in, for example, sealed containers, it is not always possible to ensure that no food will be left exposed for a period of time.\",\n",
    "    \" Also, minimising the risk of mice invasion by sealing of cracks, spaces and openings such as vents, pipes and chimney access points can be an expensive, labour intensive and a time consuming exercise and is not always possible.\",\n",
    "    \"Traditional methods of dealing with mouse invasion in the home involves the use of poisoned baits (rodenticides) that contain anticoagulants, such as warfarin, pival, brodifacoum, difethialone and chlorophacinone.\",\n",
    "    \" Such baits, while effective, are nevertheless toxic and are therefore undesirable for use in the home, particularly those in which children and pets reside.\",\n",
    "    \" In addition, poisoned mice often die in inaccessible locations thereby resulting in an unpleasant odor upon death of the mouse.\",\n",
    "    \" To circumvent these problems, mousetraps are often employed instead of poisoned baits.\",\n",
    "    \" Traps are generally preferred as these are less hazardous to use around children and pets.\",\n",
    "    \" Because mice are caught by the trap, there is less chance of odor from mice dying in wall voids or other inaccessible areas.\",\n",
    "    \" Mousetraps in the form of wooden-based snap traps are common.\",\n",
    "    \"Whilst most mousetraps are generally effective, they have the problem of exposing the homeowner, for example, to the highly undesirable task of disposing of the dead mouse once trapped.\",\n",
    "    \" Another associated disadvantage with conventional mousetrap is that once the mouse has entered the trap and accessed the bait, depending on the mouse response time, the mouse may still be able to escape by responding quickly enough to thereby avoid capture once the trap has been triggered.\",\n",
    "    \" Another disadvantage associated with many mousetraps is they allow the possibility of the mouse escaping even after entering the mousetrap as a result of poor trap design or ineffective trap triggering systems.\",\n",
    "    \"While recognising the shortcomings of prior art mousetraps, the present inventors have sought to overcome these deficiencies with a mousetrap that is able to readily capture and secure a mouse or the like with little or no possibility of escape.\",\n",
    "    \" Moreover, when captured, the mouse is in the best location on the trap to ensure an efficient kill.\",\n",
    "    \" Such traps are desirably simple and cost effective to manufacture and are also able to efficiently trap mice.\",\n",
    "    \"The invention provides a trap for capturing and/or killing a mouse, the trap comprising:an enclosure comprising a base connected to at least one movable part and which houses a trigger; the trigger comprising an adhesive section;wherein the at least one movable part is urged against the force of a biasing means from a first position wherein the trap is in a closed state into a second position in which the trap is in a set state;wherein the at least one movable part is maintained in the second position by releasably engaging the trigger; andwherein the trap is triggered upon the mouse contacting the adhesive section and elevating the trigger so as to disengage the trigger from the at least one movable part so that it moves from the second position to the first position under the force of the biasing means.\",\n",
    "    \"According to the trap of the invention, the mouse, on contacting the adhesive pad, will advantageously be held by the adhesive in an optimum position to achieve most effective capture and/or kill (ie in an “optimum capture/kill position”).\",\n",
    "    \" Moreover, by virtue of the adhesive section, for example, an adhesive pad, located on the trigger, the mousetrap is able to be triggered by elevation of the pad by the mouse as opposed to conventional traps in which triggering is often effected by depression of a triggering mechanism.\",\n",
    "    \" The novel triggering system of the invention provides a more stable and efficient capture/kill device as the mouse has to be in the “optimum capture/kill position” in order to trigger the mousetrap and so false triggering (ie when non capture or no kill occurs after trigger) is avoided or minimised.\",\n",
    "    \"It will be appreciated that the term “closed state” as used in the description encompasses the state of the trap when it is not set (ie is empty or contains a captured mouse).\",\n",
    "    \"It will also be appreciated that any type of adhesive that is sufficiently strong to hold the mouse in the “optimum kill position” and ensures lifting of the trigger as the mouse tries to escape is suitable for use in the trap of the invention.\",\n",
    "    \" Suitable adhesives include, but are not limited to, high tack hot melt adhesives (block polymers, polyamides) and double sided adhesive tapes or labels.\",\n",
    "    \"Whilst the trap according to the invention may be re-set after capture and re-used, desirably, the trap according to the invention is a single-use trap to be disposed after capture and/or killing of a mouse.\",\n",

    "    \"Particularly in traps which are desired to act as “kill traps” as opposed to “live traps” in which the mouse is simply captured, the one or more or more movable parts of the trap may further comprise one or more projections on an internal surface if the movable part, wherein the one or more projections assist in killing a mouse when the one more movable parts move from the second position to the first position under the force of the biasing means.\",\n",

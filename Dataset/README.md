# Dataset

The dataset is based on the `PaSa: A Novel Dataset for Patent Sentiment Analysis to Highlight Patent Paragraphs`, and details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/Renuk9390/Patent_Sentiment_Analysis).

As `PaSa` is paragrapph based dataset so, for training `EXPAAI Model` we need a sentence based dataset. For this every paragraph in `PaSa` is tokenized to sentences and those sentences are alotted same target class to make a sentence based dataset.
